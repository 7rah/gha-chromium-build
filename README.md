# gha-chromium-build
An attempt at bullying GitHub Actions into building Chromium. At this point, seems to be a failure due to the 6 hour time limit on workflows.

This repository is archived, since it seems like it's not viable to do this. If I figure out a better way to do this (or the limit gets extended) then that might change.
